      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        At Rubbish Radar, we believe in a world where waste has its rightful
        place. Born out of frustration from not being able to find a nearby
        trash can while on-the-go, we decided that no one should have to hold
        onto their trash any longer than necessary. From this pain point,
        Rubbish Radar emerged an innovative platform that maps trash can
        locations from user-generated input, bridging the gap between waste and
        its final destination.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        We provide an easy-to-use, comprehensive web application that allows
        users to submit and locate trash can locations. With every user's
        contribution, our network of trash can locations grows, making our
        cities and natural spaces cleaner and more enjoyable for all.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To create a global community-driven platform where every disposed of
        item finds its way to a garbage disposal promoting easy accessibility to
        our users. Through strategic placement of our thoughtfully designed
        trash cans, we are actively taking steps to reduce litter and promote
        responsible waste disposal. Every trash can we locate serves as a
        reminder of our dedication to safeguarding the environment for current
        and future generations. By encouraging proper waste management, we
        believe that even the smallest actions can create a significant and
        positive impact on the planet we all call home.

            As someone who loves to travel, I would like to have an app that
            allows me to locate public services such as trash can to avoid
            carrying trash around with me all day. As a CS major at University
            of California, Riverside, I wanted to challenge myself to find a
            solution that helps us find trash cans and hopefully makes the
            streets look cleaner.
          </td>
          <td>
            I am a Computer Science major at the University of California, San
            Diego. On this web application, I have worked on bringing the map
            implementation by working with the Google Maps API. As a frequent
            traveler, I strongly believe and see the value in Rubbish Radar as I
            have found myself looking for garbage disposal in so many places and
            always looking and scanning for a trash can.
          </td>
          <td>
            I'm a third year computer engineering student at University of
            California, Riverside. I believe public amenities such as trash
            disposables are an integral part of our lives and should be easily
            accessible. I hope this project challenges my mind to new horizons.
          </td>
          <td>
            I'm a Data Science major at UCR, so this project was a step outside
            of my comfort zone because I was working with frontend development.
            I worked with the setup of the firebase database and creating a way
            for users to input their own trash can locations onto the map. This
            project really resonated with me because I am a frequent traveler
            and I enjoy going to national parks. Finding trash cans can be a
            struggle when going to new places.
          </td>
          <td>
            I'm familiar with the NextJS framework and I enjoy hiking. I don't
            like to park in places where people leave their carts out. Nor do I
            like seeing trash on trails when I go out hiking.
